This short info note compiles the references and resources used during the development of the *Life Manager* hackathon project. It includes a variety of sources such as websites, web applications, video tutorials, role model applications, and design templates that were essential in shaping the project’s concept and execution. These materials provided the team with valuable insights into building an innovative solution aimed at simplifying daily task management.

Each reference was thoroughly reviewed to ensure adherence to best practices, current technologies, and relevant industry standards. This note of thanks is organized to showcase the diversity of the materials used, offering a clear and accessible path for those interested in exploring the knowledge that contributed to the project’s overall success.

## About the Project
As it was mentioned in our chosen we are confident that we gave our best to Create a fully functional to-do list application where users can easily manage their tasks. Users should be able to add new tasks, edit existing ones, delete them, categorize tasks into different groups (such as work, personal, or urgent), and set deadlines with reminders. Implement task prioritization and filtering options for a better user experience. The app should offer a simple yet intuitive interface, allowing users to organize and track their productivity efficiently.  
  
Here are the list of all the resources we used and in which way they actually helped us.

## INSPIRATION

|     1|      [TRELLO](https://trello.com/) -                                                                                          This web app served as the basic role model for our project and gave us the very primitive ideas of where and how to start off. Although it was written in the topic about what features should be there in our web application but it was quite impossible to think it out of the brain without any **proper example* and that was where this app came handy for us.                                          ![Uploading image.png…]()
                                                                                                    Therefore we can undoubtedly accept that, Trello, a popular project management app, served as the foundation for developing Life Manager. Its structure and functionality greatly influenced the creation of their solution for Tier I problem statements in the Hackathon. The inspiration from Trello was crucial, much like how a plant cannot survive without roots. ![alt text](Features-Graphic-Cards.jpg)         |

## GRAPHICS & DESIGN

|     1|[*GOOGLE FONTS*](https://fonts.google.com)                           -                                                           This is the app of Google which helped us to get the possible fonts for our web app name, title, user interface words and so on. This app helped us to search for cool fonts beyond the limits of the pre installed fonts in our Windows systems and we tried to make the best out of this web application.                                                                                                       ![alt text](<Google Fonts.png>)                                                                                                    Google, known for its useful apps, was essential to the hackathon project through Google Fonts. The team downloaded and installed three fonts—Comfortaa, Fredoka, and Playwrite USA (Traditional)—which were crucial for achieving a good design and maintaining a pleasant look for the web application. These fonts enhanced both the normal text and title design. ![alt text](<Google Fonts-2.png>)               |
|     2|[*COOLORS*](https://coolors.co/)                                                                             -                    For making any application, a proper colour scheme and code is necessary right? A colour scheme should be chosen very properly so that the colours and textures were according to the mood, theme and the basic tasks of the web applications. Therefore, we took the help of Coolors in this regard so that our choice becomes better as well as faster.                                                             ![alt text](Coolors-1.png)                                                                                                           The Coolors web app played a key role in designing the Life Manager web app by providing optimal color combinations that aligned with the project's themes. It simplified the process of selecting proper color shades for the user interface, saving significant time and effort. Knowing about this app made the task of choosing colors quick and efficient.                                                    ![alt text](SDH_COLORPALETTE.png)         |
|     3|[*CANVA*](https://www.canva.com/en_in/)                                                      -                                  Canva, a very popular mobile as well as a desktop app with a collection of some of the best logo templates gave us a nice preliminary idea of a proper logo based on the topic of our project. Although we used another app of the same kind for the finishing touches but the initial logo making thoughts came to our minds by having a look at Canva's wonderful collection.                                    ![alt text](Canva-1.png)                                                                                                             Canva, a widely known logo maker app, was the team's top choice for creating an attractive logo for their web app. Its free designs and templates made the process easy, offering enough creative options to eliminate concerns about logo design. With Canva’s premade ideas, only a bit of creativity was needed to complete the task.                                                                               ![alt text](Canva-2-1.jpg)               |
|     4|[*PIXLR](https://pixlr.com/)          -                                                                                      PIXLR web application helped us in the completion of our logo designing. **Since it doesnt matter how you begin it but what matters is how you end it*, I cant express how much grateful we are to the contributions of this app for finishing the logo.                                         ![alt text](PixlR-1.png)                                                                                                            Pixlr played a crucial role in finalizing the layout and logo for the hackathon project. While the initial logo was created using Canva, Pixlr was used for minor but important finishing touches. These small adjustments made the logo more refined and attractive, highlighting the app's significance in completing the design.                                                                        ![alt text](PixlR-2.png)               |
